alphamote - Free Sony alpha camera remote tools
===============================================

alphamote is a work in progress to build a libusb-based
replacement for Sony's Remote Camera Control software.

Why? Sony's software does not run on free Unix systems
and can not be scripted ...

For now, there is no Makefile, so run

gcc -o alphamote-init init.c -lusb
gcc -o alphamote-trigger trigger.c -lusb

./alphamote-init
./alphamote-trigger

should then create a /tmp/foo.jpg file.
