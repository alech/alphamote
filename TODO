TODOs:

- if possible, split shutter and image downloading in trigger.c
  (this probably means being able to downloading images created by
  pressing the shutter physically)
- record USB traffic for changing settings other than aperture
- figure out when file from camera is available for download
- figure out how the camera reports if a photo could not be taken
- In trigger.c, read filename from the camera and use it as a default
